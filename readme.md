Project Overview

We'll build a simple web application that allows users to:

Create new tasks.
Read the list of existing tasks.
Update task details (e.g., mark as completed).
Delete tasks.

Development Steps

Set up a Django project: We'll start by creating a new Django project and app.
Define the Task model: We'll create a model to represent our tasks, including fields like task description and completion status.
Create views: We'll write views to handle user interactions, such as displaying the task list, adding new tasks, and updating/deleting tasks.
Design templates: We'll create HTML templates to render the task list and forms for adding/editing tasks.
Configure URLs: We'll set up URL patterns to map URLs to our views.
Implement forms: We'll use Django forms to handle user input for creating and updating tasks.
