# My First Django To-Do List Application

## Introduction

Hey there! This is my very first Django project, a simple To-Do List application. As someone venturing into development outside of my primary focus in data science, I wanted to dive into Django and build something practical. This project has been an incredible learning experience, and I'm excited to share it with you.

## Learning Experience

Coming from a data science background, venturing into web development with Django was a new and exciting challenge. I've learned a ton about:

* **Models:** Defining data structures and interacting with the database.
* **Views:** Handling user requests and processing data.
* **Templates:** Creating dynamic HTML pages.
* **Forms:** Managing user input.
* **URL Routing:** Mapping URLs to views.
* **Project Structure:** Understanding how Django projects are organized.

This project has given me a solid foundation in Django, and I'm eager to continue exploring its capabilities and building more complex applications.

## Features

* Create new tasks.
* View a list of all tasks.
* Update task status (e.g., mark as completed).
* Delete tasks.
